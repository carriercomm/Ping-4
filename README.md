# Ping

Ping is a chat server which is in the process of development using node.js 


### Tech

Ping uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
* [Nodemon] - Monitor for any changes in your node.js application and automatically restart the server - perfect for development
* [Gravatar] - Globally recognized avatar.
* [jQuery] - duh

### How to deploy the application

You need [node.js] installed globally:

Go to the root directory of the application and run

```sh
$ npm start
```

Included the node_modules, so no need to run the following command, but if you change the dependencies in package.json, do run

```sh
$ npm install
```
